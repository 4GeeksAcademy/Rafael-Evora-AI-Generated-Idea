# Implementation Plan --- AI Usage Guide

This document serves as a **living implementation record** for the project.

It defines all planned and completed features, milestones, and technical steps required to reach and evolve the MVP.

## 🧠 AI Interaction Rules

1. **Always read this file before beginning any new feature or code change.**
   Use it to understand what features exist, their current status, and dependencies.

2. **When adding a new feature:**
   - Duplicate the "Feature Implementation Plan Model" shown below.
   - Replace all placeholder fields (`[Feature Name]`, etc.) with real details.
   - Insert the new feature under the appropriate section (MVP, Post-MVP, or Other).
   - Maintain consistent formatting.

3. **When updating progress:**
   - Update the **Status** field.
   - Check off relevant items in **Implementation Steps** and **Acceptance Criteria**.
   - Update the **Last Updated** date.
   - If implementation details evolve, expand the "Technical Breakdown" or "Testing Notes."

4. **When completing a major milestone (e.g., MVP deployment):**
   - Add a short summary entry at the bottom under "Development Notes" describing what changed or was achieved.

5. **Do not delete or overwrite past feature sections.**
   - Instead, mark them as "Complete" and update the timestamp.
   - This document should reflect a chronological record of development history.
